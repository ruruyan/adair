        <p>Since 2024, Adaïr has been designing with purpose—not just jewelry.
        In 2026, we take a playful yet meaningful turn into the medical field, creating discreet, portable medical devices where Swiss design meets everyday fidgeting needs.
        We are looking for psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors, and healthcare professionals to co-create human-centered solutions with us.
        Curious? Inspired? Know someone who might be?

        And this is just the beginning.</p>
